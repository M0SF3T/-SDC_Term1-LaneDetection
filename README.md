Project #1 from the Udacity Self-Driving Car program (SDC).
The algorithm uses basic image processing techniques such as edge-detection and trigonometric operations to detect road lines.

Tools and Techniques
---

* Implemented in Python
* Jupyter Notebooks
* OpenCV

Reflections
---
Pros: Easy to understand, simple to implement and test.
Cons: Not very robust, bad road conditions, weather, hills etc will drastically affect results.
